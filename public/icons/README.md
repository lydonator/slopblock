# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (toolbar icon, small)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (extension management page)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (Chrome Web Store, installation)

## Creating Icons

You can create icons using:
1. Any image editor (Photoshop, GIMP, Figma, etc.)
2. Online tools like https://www.favicon-generator.org/
3. Icon generation services

## Temporary Placeholder

For development, you can use simple placeholder icons. The actual icons should:
- Be clear and recognizable at small sizes
- Follow SlopBlock's color scheme (primarily red #ff6b6b)
- Include a warning or alert symbol to indicate the purpose
- Be saved as PNG with transparency

## TODO

Replace these placeholder instructions with actual icon files before release.
