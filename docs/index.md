## What is SlopBlock?

SlopBlock is a Chromium browser extension that enables crowdsourced identification and filtering of AI-generated "slop" content on YouTube. Users can mark videos as AI-generated, and when enough trusted reports are received, the extension displays warning icons on thumbnails across YouTube's interface.

### Key Features

- **Community Reporting**: Mark videos as AI-generated with a single click
- **Visual Warnings**: See warning icons on thumbnails before clicking
- **Trust System**: Hybrid trust scoring prevents abuse while maintaining accuracy
- **Privacy First**: Anonymous reporting with no personal data collection
- **Open Source**: 100% transparent, auditable code
