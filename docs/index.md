## What is SlopBlock?

SlopBlock is a Chromium browser extension that enables crowdsourced identification and filtering of AI-generated "slop" content on YouTube. Users can mark videos as AI-generated, and when the community trust threshold is reached, the extension displays warning icons on thumbnails across YouTube's interface.
